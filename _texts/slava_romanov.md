PNCTM converges the past and present through the intimate lens of personal memory and perception. It weaves the complex dialogue between historical diaslides and contemporary digital emanations.


The medium of collectible, archival, and simply discarded transparencies is disconnected from its original contexts. PNCTM reanimates these fragments by engaging AI and generative tools to expand, distort, reimagine and highlight the static images. This process mirrors the fluidity and transcience of memory, as it fades, transforms and distorts over time. The intermedial dialogue embodies the idea of the plurality of perception.


Each object in the installation invites the viewer to make a personal connection with the imagery through a literal lens. A magnifying glass intensifies the viewing experience, seeking an ASMR effect, and concentrating the attention on the micro-movements and shifts in the narratives unfolding through the overlays.


Inspired by Roland Barthes' notion of the 'punctum' in 'Camera Lucida', the installation seeks to evoke the unexpected, poignant moment of personal resonance within each viewer. Drawing on David Le Breton's perspectives on perception and Susan Sontag's critical exploration of photography and memory, the installation challenges viewers to consider how memories are constructed and reconstructed â€” shaped by individual subjective lenses and the collective memory of society.


By combining tactile historical media with fluid digital interactions, PNCTM aims to evoke a reflective dialogue about the impermanence and malleability of memory. It invites viewers to discover their own perceptions, and their unique punctums, and to engage in a deeper conversation about the manipulation of historical narratives through contemporary lenses.
