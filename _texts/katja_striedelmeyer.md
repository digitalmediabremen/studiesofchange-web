excerpt: "Sphagnum moss certainly has a relationship with living and dying that is not comparable to the human experience. It can dry out, but once it is rehydrated, it may come back to life.Rehydrating Sphagnum Moss is a speculation about reviving dried mosses that are stored in numerous archives for scientific research. An analog projector called episcope serves as an magnification device to be able to observe the process of rehydration closely."
