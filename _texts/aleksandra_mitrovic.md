excerpt: "“Come on baby light my fire” is an installation that deconstructs internet interaction through a live video chatting platform, transforming it into a tangible experience, employing a web camera, an infrared heat lamp and an embodied sound chair(chair with a built-in speaker) to symbolise the presence of “the other person”. To achieve this, a deep learning object detection model is utilised to recognise several categories on the popular site for random anonymous video interaction, commonly associated with exhibitionism and sexualised content. The system translates the values assigned to these categories into heat and red light, signalling the presence of nudity as highest."
