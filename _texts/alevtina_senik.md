how often do we pay attention to sounds? close, detailed, and focused attention to everything we hear around us. in ecological terms, sounds form a co-dependent relationship, they are all connected. in prevailing urbanistic living, this connection is often lost. sounds are sensational and provide information about our surroundings. they do not exist freely, they are essential for survival. the current installation, inspired by soundscape ecology research, aims to articulate the sounds within a locality. through the imaginary landscape, installation invites to delve into the notion of sonic relationships between objects, textures, touches, and their interlacements.
