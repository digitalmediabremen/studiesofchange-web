Border, limit, frontier, limit, edge — all of those words express belarusian «miaža» — a concept that has devalued itself in recent times. We (the authors of this video) met Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in Minsk. A smattering of anti-war rallies, growing atomisation and alienation of communities, an effort not to relive the guilt of the ensuing catastrophe in an escape from reality — all of which prompted us to write absurdist dialogue and film using an intricate system of reflections.

The subtle, almost tearing space of disrupted communication is superimposed one on one, urging the question: Huh? All that remains for the viewer is to observe the dialog itself and the fabric of interaction. It is not meant to be understood, but only to fill a void.
