"A Nkisi-horse capable of communicating, thanks to the load it carries inside".
A "Set-up" media installation, where hybridized media and different elements, questions the assimilation and perception of artistic media. Under the premise that perhaps, smuggling seems to be the vehicle to infiltrate agencies and discourses.
The whole installation, from simulation and DIY attitudes, is a commentary on the ways of socializing and promoting a certain event. Where the event hosts this art-object waiting to be traded.
A sculptured object representing a horse; which conforms, in its execution, to the totemic and animistic practices of the religious practice of the Afro-Cuban Palo-Monte. This Nkisi-Horse that has been previously charged, to deliver messages in the air; for those who willingly chose to read them. Through WiFi-hotspots generated by this wooden statuette; the message, in the form of text, is transmitted.
This object will soon be available for sale on a virtual platform, which is responsible for promoting various emerging creators, who are still in the process of formation.
