excerpt: "Based on the Aerocene project that proposes a change of life philosophies to overcome the Anthropocene. The installation explores the modern air and its sonorous particularities as a mechanism of dialogue on the confrontation of climate change, the deconstruction of geopolitical boundaries and an epistemological revision of the relationship between man and nature. To this end, different aspects converge to drive a mechanism that drops a seed inviting us to question our environments and future perspectives."
