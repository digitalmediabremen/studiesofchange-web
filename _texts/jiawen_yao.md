In this video essay, leak in the promiscuous machines and prurient governing entities is brought to the forefront as systemic vulnerabilities. A message you send out to your loved one over the TCP/IP protocol is slutty. Audio and video signal cables are constantly radiating RF emanations. Buffer overflows when data overwrites, memory leaks when the old memory is not released, software ages, like human beings, aging leads to more leaks. In addition to that, our faces are reduced to facial features for machine learning, personal medical records end as image embedding in a training dataset. We, as users and as citizens, are encouraged by the big tech and governments to leak, while the large language models trained from the data we leaked, refuse to “participate in or encourage any illegal activities, including leaking.”

let yourself l̴͓̥̠̼̏̑̃̂̂͘ḛ̷̺̟͓͈̜̓̋̍̄̆ä̸̞̝̳́̾̓̈̾k̷͎̰̓̒͘ a little leaks through the cracks on the leaking gas pipe, the space station, the express warehouse, into the leaking signals, leaky compression algorithms, leaky network packets, leaking categories, leaked tiny face and tiny activity dataset, to ask who is making it’s not ok to leak, who is capturing leak, how leak is weaponized and who is killing leak to stop solidarity from happening.
