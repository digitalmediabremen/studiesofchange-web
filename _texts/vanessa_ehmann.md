"Conspiracy overflow" is a media art installation that explores the conspiracy theories surrounding Covid and the Covid vaccine. It plays with the stereotypes and provokes using symbols like sheep, gnomes and spiky front gardens. Also it tracks your bluetooth devices which fuel this artwork.
The transmission of information by humans is never that accurate or correct, we are all biased by our own beliefs and perceptions; and on top of that we are overwhelmed by information overload. Does a GPS tracker really fit in a vaccination needle? And aren't we already being analysed and tracked by our phones, by location services or by algorithms that record our usage patterns and sell them on to third parties?
