Storyboard: Because I can die on another land, they want me to package my father's funeral to shame me.

This is a simulation of a funeral delivery, telling the story of a group of Chinese people planning to immigrate illegally to the United States. Unable to obtain U.S. visas, these individuals resort to unconventional methods by first traveling to South America and then heading north across the U.S. border. They attempt to escape their current living conditions in search of a better life, but face skepticism from their fellow countrymen. Their homeland can no longer accommodate them, forcing them to take everything with them, including funerals.
