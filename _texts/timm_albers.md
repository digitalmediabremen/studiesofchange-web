To Regulate the Noise investigates the relation between modes of interaction and technological media, as well as cognitive and technical processing. The sound installation consists of six objects hanging from the ceiling, which echo their sonic environment. For this, they record, transform and play back, while attempting to steer the soundscape by means of their inherent control logic. Since the output of each object influences its input, the installation creates audible feedback. The objects' agenda is to keep the level in the room at a specified value, which causes them to amplify or attenuate, depending on the input level.
