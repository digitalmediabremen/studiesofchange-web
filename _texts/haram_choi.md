This machine counts, in binary, starting from 0 up to 4,294,967,295 that is 2³²-1. A reasonably modern computer will need only a few seconds to count that amount of numbers(approx. 4.2 billion). By using a mechanism called Linear Feedback Shift Register, it may take more, but not more than a few minutes, depending on the power of the processing unit. If, say, I count one in every second with no pause, it will take 136.192519533 years.

And now, have a look at this machine and count in seconds. How many seconds does it need for a single count? Since this machine depends on electricity, in order to prevent any misfortune of forgetting the current count in cases such as power loss, it creates another dependency on the physical realm, by storing every bit of its count in 32 independent toggle switches. And so does the machine tries to bridge between binary and physical, by the incarnation of a purely logical binary information.

Light turns on, only after the last bit.
