Goal Seeking consists of small simple robots with a vibration motor that are only powered through a solar panel and external artificial light sources. In a space to their own, the small, simple robots move around. Their energy cycle is wasteful, the space is confined and the movements of the robots are seemingly irrelevant, but through their number and the boundaries bringing the robots together, collective behavior emerges. The robots are unknowingly (due to the lack of sensing) working together towards an unknown and unspecified goal. Without a defined goal, the seeking continues. Once the light turns off, all the movement stops.
