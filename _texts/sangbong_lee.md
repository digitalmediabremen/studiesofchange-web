excerpt: "Hidden dependency is an artistic research and experiment about the idea called dependant origination.According to this notion, a particular event or being reflects only a fragment of the whole world and time. By reassembling pieces of the whole, we can approximate a closer picture of the complex interconnection between every entity and its dependency at that moment.Laser projection triggered by the voice reveals other laser patterns on the wall that are generated by imperceptible but surely existing signals that construct the moment in the area."

Hidden dependency is an artistic research and experiment about the idea called dependant origination.

According to this notion, a particular event or being reflects only a fragment of the whole world and time. By reassembling pieces of the whole, we can approximate a closer picture of the complex interconnection between every entity and its dependency at that moment.

Laser projection triggered by the voice reveals other laser patterns on the wall that are generated by imperceptible but surely existing signals that construct the moment in the area.
