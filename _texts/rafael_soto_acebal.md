"001" is a project in process; that explores the inherent tension in the coexistence of opposing forces, inspired by the duality between the Apollonian and the Dionysian. Through forces applied by motors, tension is generated on a TPU cloth, which the tension is revealed through polarized filters using the principle of photoelasticity. This technique allows for the visualization of invisible forces, making the invisible visible.

The concept of the work focuses on how seemingly polarized elements not only coexist but also influence each other, creating a dance of tensions and balances. The stretched and tensioned plastic cloth symbolizes the struggle and harmony between these forces. The Apollonian represents order, logic, and serenity, while the Dionysian embodies chaos, emotion, and passion. The interaction of these forces in the work reflects the complexity and beauty of the coexistence of opposites.
