A temporal object catches glimpses of a camera seeing through someone else's eye. In Bremen, a pipeline near the Stadtwaldsee was photographed using a Chinese smartphone purchased two years ago from an Alibaba Group website. "A.I. as a function" was being used to shoot it, creating an image out of noise, discerning a fragment of infrastructure out of supposedly sensible digital data. Often overlooked or taken for granted, infrastructure encompasses systems and structures that enable the functioning of our cities and communities, from roads, bridges, power grids and heating, to art history, governance, logistics and communication networks.
