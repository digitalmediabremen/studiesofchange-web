The Privileged Land (v1.0) is an ongoing multimedia practice of translating the status quo of living in Germany as a South Korean woman in the current times.

Youngji Cho has been struggled to fall asleep since the beginning of October 2023. The ongoing genocide triggered her intergenerational trauma of war, death, colonisation, and division. She sometimes regretted her decision to move to Germany, frustrated, suffering, stuck, and feeling privileged to live in this country. There are many irrational, illogical, and inhumane things happening, and she was unable to produce any artworks for a while. Then she began to write down some words, sentences, and paragraphs that remained in her mind when she woke up. After writing, she closed her notes and opened her phone to record her voice with her thoughts, feelings, random sounds, and songs that came naturally to her after writing, which was often emotional. The audio of this work is a selection of a few pieces from over 90 recordings over 73 days from December 2023 to February 2024.

The complete work of The Privileged Land (v1.0) is presented as an audiovisual installation on a portrait view of a 4K screen, where a video of a closed flame is played together with an audio collage. The audience may not be sure what the image is when the video starts to play, but as the angle of the video begins to zoom out, they may slowly notice the flame.

Fire, is artificial, yet, primitive.

Fire, may be the oldest television, may entertain me, you, her, him, and them, the privileged.
