Studies of Change will be an exhibition by 26 artists from the Hochschule für Künste Bremen that links art with technological, social, ecological, and political realms.
From 29th May to 2nd June 2024 it will open the doors of Bremen’s Alte Pathologie to offer new ways of looking at the former municipal site.

The variety of new media artworks has been produced in the Digital Media program at the Hochschule für Künste under the guidance of Professor Ralf Baecker. Simple robots powered through light, a mechanical orchestra performing real-time data from commodity stocks, explorations of the voice in both the physical and phenomenological senses, as well as interrogations of embedded vectors in AI and speculations on time and computational perceptions –- all spectacularly placed in what appears to be an empty building that still bears traces of the past.

Liminality brings the past into the present. The place that was once driven by the study of life cycles, now nurtures the exploration of life as a whole. At first, it may seem that there is little connection between the objects and the places they are situated. But everything is organically related. Just as life and death are inseparable, each work anticipates change as a difference between states. It is as if the process becomes the element that makes it possible to abandon interpretation in favor of perception.
