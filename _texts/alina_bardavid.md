excerpt: "Assembled from obsolete electronic components and everyday detritus, these ‘sacha1 toys’ are reimagined to question the essence of their existence and provoke dialogue about the ephemeral nature of identity and value. Now, these transformed objects serve as instruments of destruction, juxtaposing the physical deformation of currency with its conceptual worth, reflecting the constant flux that defines both the material world and our own sense of self.1 In Argentina, 'sacha' is commonly used informally to describe something as fake, similar to 'pseudo-' or 'quasi-' in English. This colloquial usage indicates a less authentic or lower-quality imitation of the original; however, the term actually originates from Quechua, where it typically refers to something wild."

1 In Argentina, 'sacha' is commonly used informally to describe something as fake, similar to 'pseudo-' or 'quasi-' in English. This colloquial usage indicates a less authentic or lower-quality imitation of the original; however, the term actually originates from Quechua, where it typically refers to something wild.
