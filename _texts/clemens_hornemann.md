Automated Ritual no.1 is a dystopic, mechanical orchestra, sonifying modern stock market data of commodities. The archaic and raw instruments in this orchestra are replicas of Stone Age instruments that were found across Europe and are harnessed and played by contrasting machines and motors. Rituals and the hunt in which the instruments might have been used 7-40 thousand years ago, were replaced by a complex dirty machinery of modern forecast systems and stock market speculations. The goods, the concerned commodities we trade on the other hand, that we deal with and need to survive, havenâ€™t changed a lot.
